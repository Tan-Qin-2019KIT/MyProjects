SEIFE --- seismic waveform filters
============================================================================

For compilation instructions see README.1st in the root directory.

libseife is a collection of Fortran 77 functions and subroutines for time
series analysis and digital filters. It is a full-grown signal processing
toolbox. A C API to the Fortran 77 code is provided as well.

This library contains code which was extracted from the program seife.f
by Erhard Wielandt. The original version was written in 1984 at ETH Zurich.
The code can be obtained through
http://www.software-for-seismometry.de/

The code from seife.f was extracted to a library by Wolfgang Friederich in
1996. The current version of libseife is a an extended code collection based
on the abovementioned code. 

Installation
------------
environment variables:
  LOCLIBDIR           defines location of binary libraries
  LOCINCLUDEDIR       defines location of C header files (prototypes)

Fortran version:      libseife.a
C version:            libcseife.a

make all              installs headers and binary libraries

Dependencies
------------
  external dependencies: -
  internal dependencies: -

Arrays in C version
-------------------

The proper definition of arrays and parameters to be passed to the C-API of
libseife becomes obvious in function seife_first, which is defined in cseife.c
A call

  seife_first(x, n);

will address elements x[0] to x[n-1] in C-array x.
