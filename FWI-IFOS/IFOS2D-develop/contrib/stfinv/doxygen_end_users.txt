\section page_eu_sec_users The library libstfinv for end-users

\subsection page_eu_subsec_introduction Introduction

  The purpose of this library is to provide methods for the derivation of
  source wavelet correction filters
  in approaches to full waveform inversion.
  Given a set of recorded data and a set of synthetic data (typically,
  but not necessarilly the impulse response of the subsurface) a source
  wavelet correction filter
  is obtained due to some optimization citerion.
  The synthetic waveforms are convolved with this filter
  wavelet and the convolved
  synthetics as well as the wavelet itself are returned to the user.

  The source wavelet correction filter
  in this context not necessarily is the actual
  force time history of the source used in the experiment or a similar
  quantity of physical meaning.
  The source wavelet correction filter
  simply is the wavelet which minimizes the misfit
  between synthetic and recorded waveforms due to some misfit condition, if
  the synthetics are concolved with this wavelet.
  In particular this implies that the synthetics not necessarily need be the
  impulse response (Greens function) of the subsurface, they may simply be
  synthetic waveforms computed for some generic source wavelet (like a
  Ricker wavelet).
  The derived source wavelet correction filter
  then has to be understood with respect to
  this generic wavelet.

\subsection page_eu_subsec_parameters How to construct parameter strings
  A specific engine is selected by passing a parameter string to the library
  interface like function ::initstfinvengine() or the constructor of the
  interface class stfinv::STFEngine::STFEngine().
  This parameter string may further contain parameters to control the
  execution mode of the engine.

  The parameter string starts with an ID-sequence identifying the desired
  engine.
  This ID-sequences are stored in stfinv::STFEngineFDLeastSquares::ID
  for the Fourier domain least squares engine.
  In the parameter string the ID-sequence is terminated by a colon (:).

  After selecting the desired engine, the interface function strips of the
  ID-sequence as well as the colon from the parameter string and initializes
  the engine, passing the references to user workspace as well as the rest
  of the parameter string.
  The rest of the parameter string may consist of several control
  parameters being separated by colons (:).
  Each control parameter may just be a flag (switch to turn an option on) or
  may come along with a parameter value.
  The value of the parameter is separated by an equal sign (=).

  \par Examples
    - To select frequency domain least squares
      (stfinv::STFEngineFDLeastSquares) and shift the returned source
      correction wavelet 
      by 0.4s and switch on verbose mode, pass the following
      parameter string:
      \verbatim fdlsq:tshift=0.4:verbose \endverbatim
    - To select stfinv::STFEngineIdentity and to switch on debug level 4:
      \verbatim ident:DEBUG=4 \endverbatim
    - To select stfinv::STFEngineFDLeastSquares, apply offset dependent
      weights and use a power of two to speed up the FFT:
      \verbatim fdlsq:pow2:exp=1.4 \endverbatim
