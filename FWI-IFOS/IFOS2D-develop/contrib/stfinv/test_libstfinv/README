README for Test_libstfinv
=========================

Test_libstfinv is a small C programme to test the C interface to libstfinv (for
its use in the 2D elastic inversion code DENISE). The programme can be compiled 
by the Makefile in the directory 'src'. 

To run the programme one first has to prepare an input file like
Test_libstfinv.inp. In this input file one has to define su-files containing the 
measured data and the synthetic data and the number of traces included in these 
su-files. Also the names of the output files and the parameter string selecting 
the applied engine for source wavelet inversion have to be defined in the input
file. 

After compiling and preparing the input file one can run the programme via:

	Test_libstfinv <name of parameterfile>  
	
	(e.g. Test_libstfinv Test_libstfinv.inp)

+ read_parameters.c, fd.h, globvar.h:
  As mentioned at the beginning of this README file this programme serves as a
  test of libstfinv for its use in DENISE. Therefore, I tried to already use the
  structure of the DENISE code. Consequently some files are copied from the 
  DENISE code and adjusted for this testprogramme. This affects the files:
	* read_parameters.c
	* fd.h
	* globvar.h
