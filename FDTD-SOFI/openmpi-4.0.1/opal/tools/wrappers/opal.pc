# Note that the EXTRA_LIBS are only necessary when static linking
# (they're pulled in via libopen-pal.so's implicit dependencies), so
# list them in Libs.private.

# It is safe to hard-wire the -I before the EXTRA_INCLUDES because we
# will not be installing this .pc file unless --enable-devel-headers is
# selected, meaning that there will definitely be a value in EXTRA_INCLUDES.
