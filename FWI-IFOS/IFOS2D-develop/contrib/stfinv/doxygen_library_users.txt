\section page_u_sec_users The library libstfinv for users

\subsection page_u_subsec_introduction Introduction

  The purpose of this library is to provide methods for the derivation of
  source wavelet correction filters
  in approaches to full waveform inversion.
  Given a set of recorded data and a set of synthetic data (typically,
  but not necessarilly the impulse response of the subsurface) a source
  wavelet correction filter
  is obtained due to some optimization citerion.
  The synthetic waveforms are convolved with this filter
  wavelet and the convolved
  synthetics as well as the wavelet itself are returned to the user.

  The source wavelet correction filter
  in this context not necessarily is the actual
  force time history of the source used in the experiment or a similar
  quantity of physical meaning.
  The source wavelet correction filter
  simply is the wavelet which minimizes the misfit
  between synthetic and recorded waveforms due to some misfit condition, if
  the synthetics are concolved with this wavelet.
  In particular this implies that the synthetics not necessarily need be the
  impulse response (Greens function) of the subsurface, they may simply be
  synthetic waveforms computed for some generic source wavelet (like a
  Ricker wavelet).
  The derived source wavelet correction filter
  then has to be understood with respect to
  this generic wavelet.

  The library provides different \ref engines to find an optimal source
  wavelet correction filter.
  The basic steps of operation are:
   -# Initialize an engine.
      In this step pointers to arrays are passed to
      the engine together with some header information.
      The engines memorizes these pointers and expects to find the recorded
      data as well as the synthetics at the inidcated locations in memory.
   -# Call the run()-function of the engine.
      The engine takes the recorded and synthetic data currently found at
      the memory arrays, calculates an optimzed correction filter 
      wavelet and returns the
      wavelet together with the convolved synthetics by copying them to the
      memory locations inidicated by the initializer of the engine.
      This step is repeated after each computation of synthetic data.
   -# Remove the engine once you terminate the iteration of inversion.
