 * REVISIONS and CHANGES 
 *  - 19/12/2002   V1.0   Thomas Forbriger
 *  - 02/01/2003   V1.1   (thof)
 *                        - did not resolve cout and endl in namespace std
 *  - 19/12/2003   V1.2   (thof)
 *                        - there was a redundant semicolon in the output of
 *                           the CODE macro
 *                        - sorry: returned to previous definition to stay
 *                          consistent with older code. each line of CODE()
 *                          must be closed with a semicolon
