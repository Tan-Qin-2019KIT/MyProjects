# Procedures in the Fourier domain
# --------------------------------
Options and parameters in common for procedures in the Fourier domain:
  fpow2              use power of two for number of coefficients
  fdiv=d             use integer multiple of d for number of coefficients
  fpad=f             padding factor
  tshift=d           delay source correction filter wavelet by d (in seconds)
                     in order to expose acausal components
  irtap=t1,t2,t3,t4  taper impulse response of correction filter

These options define the number of samples N used for the FFT (Fast Fourier
Transform). This number N should be larger than the number of samples M in the
original input time series to avoid wrap-around. If fpow2 is set, N will be
the next power of 2 larger than M*f. Else if fdiv is set, N will be the next
integer multiple of d larger than M*f. If fdiv is not set explicitely, a
default value for d (commonly 100) is used. If option fpad ist used, N will be
f times larger than without padding. Without explicitely setting fpad, a
default value for f is used (which commonly equals 1.5). When defining the
number of samples N, first padding is considered (fpad), then the either
selection of a power of two (pow2) or the divisor criterion (fdiv) is applied.
The latter is only applied, if pow2 ist not selected.

Input time series with M samples will be padded with (N-M) zeros to create the
time series which actually will be transformed to the Fourier domain. Upon
inverse FFT the additional (N-M) samples of the resulting time series will be
discarded before returning the M remaining samples to the caller. Note, that
this is a form of implicite taper. In particular the caller will not obtain
exactly the filter response, which was used for convolution internally.

The derived correction filter in some cases can contain acausal components.
This means that the impulse response is non-zero for negative time values.
Since by definition, the impulse response is output for the time interval of
the input data, these acausal components can remain unnoticed. The option
tshift can be used to shift the impulse response as obtained by inverse FFT in
order to expose acausal components.

A time domain taper can be applied to the impulse response of the correction
filter by using option irtap. Four time values are given in units of seconds:
t1, t2, t3, and t4. They must be in increasing order and (t4-t1) must be
smaller than the total duration of the time series used to represent signals
internally. Times value are allowed to be negative. Time series are understood
to be periodic (due to discrete Fourier transformation). Prior to application
of the correction filter to the time series passed to the algorithm, the
correction filter is transformed to the time domain, tapered, and then
transformed to the Fourier domain again. The values of the taper are:
  0                              if       t <  t1
  0.5-0.5*cos(pi*(t-t1)/(t2-t1)) if t1 <= t <= t2
  1                              if t2 <  t <  t3
  0.5+0.5*cos(pi*(t-t3)/(t3-t4)) if t3 <= t <= t4
  0                              if       t >  t4

Time values are given in the same unit in which the sampling interval is given
in the input time series. I.e. if sampling interval is specified as a fraction
of seconds (which is standard) then all time values passed as parameters are
also given as fractions or multiples of seconds.
