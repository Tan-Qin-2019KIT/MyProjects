How to control the procedure
----------------------------
A specific procedure is selected by passing a parameter string. This string
may further contain parameters to control the way the procedure will be
applied.

The parameter string starts with an ID-sequence identifying the desired
procedure. See the list available procedures for ID strings. In the parameter
string the ID-sequence is terminated by a colon (:).

After selecting the desired procedure, the interface function strips off the
ID-sequence as well as the first colon from the parameter string. The
remainder may consist of several control parameters being separated by colons
(:). Each control parameter may just be a flag (switch to turn on an option)
or may come along with a parameter value. The value is separated from the
parameter by an equal sign (=).

Where several values in an argument to a parameter must be separated (like in
the 'irtap' option of the Fourier domain procedures) white space ( ), commas
(,), and semicolons (;) are allowed as field delimiters, at your convenience.

Examples:
- To select Fourier domain least squares and shift the returned source
  correction filter wavelet by 0.4s and switch on verbose mode, pass the
  following parameter string:
    fdlsq:tshift=0.4:verbose
- To select the identity procedure and switch on debug level 4:
    ident:DEBUG=4
- To select Fourier domain least squares, apply offset dependent weights and
  use a power of two to speed up the FFT:
    fdlsq:pow2:exp=1.4
