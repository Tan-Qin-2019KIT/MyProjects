# Common control parameters
# -------------------------
Options and parameters in common for all procedures:
  verbose       produce verbose output (if implemented)
  DEBUG=l       produce debug output with level l
  exp=k         apply offset dependent weights to signals

Due to the amplitude decay with offset to the source signals from receivers at
larger offset would contribute less to the optimization criterion for which
the source wavelet correction filter is constructed. The option exp provides
means to add a weight factor ((r/1m)**k) to each signal, where r is the
receiver to source offset. This is used to compensate the decrease in signal
amplitude. If the energy in the original signal decays with ((-r/1m)**(2*k))
all traces will contribute at a similar level to the derived correction filter
after application of the weight factors.
