# What is SOFI2D?

**SOFI2D** stands for Seismic mOdeling with FInite differences and denotes our
2D viscoelastic time domain massive parallel modeling code for P- and SV-waves.   

SOFI2D is the forward solver for the full waveform inversion code [**IFOS2D**](https://git.scc.kit.edu/GPIAG-Software/IFOS2D).

The [**manual**](https://git.scc.kit.edu/GPIAG-Software/SOFI2D/wikis/home) and a reference paper is included 
in the download archive 
or can be downloaded [here](https://git.scc.kit.edu/GPIAG-Software/SOFI2D/wikis/home).
