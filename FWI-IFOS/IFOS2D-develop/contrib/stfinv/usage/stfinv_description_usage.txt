STFINV -- create and apply a source wavelet correction filter
=============================================================

Different methods are provided for the derivation of source wavelet correction
filters in approaches to full waveform inversion. Given a set of recorded data
and a set of synthetic data (typically, but not necessarilly the expected
impulse response of the subsurface) a source wavelet correction filter is
obtained by application of a user-selectable optimization citerion. The
synthetic waveforms are convolved with this filter wavelet and the convolved
synthetics as well as the wavelet itself are returned to the user.

The effective time history of the seismic source used in field recordings is
not well known in most cases. This applies in particular to transient sources
(like explosives or hammer blows). The so-called 'source-time-function' might
even vary from shot to shot. For this reason it is not possible to use an
appropriate source-time-function in the initial simulation of synthetic data
in an approach of full-waveform inversion. However, after synthetic data have
been calculated using a generic source-time-function, a correction filter can
be constructed such that an improved source-time-function will reduce the
misfit to the recorded data.
