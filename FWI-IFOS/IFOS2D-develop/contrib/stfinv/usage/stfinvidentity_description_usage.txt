Procedure: Scale with amplitude factor
--------------------------------------
This procedure does not modify the waveform of the synthetic data. It
convolves the signales with a discrete delta pulse so to speak. Optionally the
synthetics are scaled with an amplitude factor such that the weighted average
signal energy of all traces in the scaled synthetics equals that of the
recordings. Offset dependent weights are applied in this case. The
appropriately scaled discrete delta pulse is returned as correction filter.

Options and parameters:
  scaleenergy   if flag is set: scale energy
