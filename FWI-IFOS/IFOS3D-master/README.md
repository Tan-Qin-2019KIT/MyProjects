# What is IFOS3D?

**IFOS3D** (**I**nversion of **F**ull **O**bserved **S**eismograms) is a 3D elastic full waveform inversion code.  
The inversion problem is solved by a conjugate gradient method and the gradients are computed in the frequency domain with the adjoint method.  
The forward modeling is done by a time domain finite difference scheme. 

IFOS3D is the reverse (inverse) of our 3D finite difference forward solver [**SOFI3D**](https://git.scc.kit.edu/GPIAG-Software/SOFI3D).
